project: kreatywa specializes in enhancing and reinvigorating your organisations day-to-day practices of production and delivery of digital content for specific audience.

the key to the success is the team. applying some backward engeniring you might as well assume that if the product is good the team responsible for its delivery must be good. conversly if the product is shit, the team is shit and there is hardly any point in trying to make golden statues out of shit.

our task however is different because we aim for the future and there isn't much future in the past is there. over the years in never ending and relentless drive towards innovation that seems to be consuming the world we ended up with a highly skilled and astonishingly devious team of emotionally imbalanced and volotile arsonists, rebeals and other ssuch subversive types.

each single member of the team is a member of MENSA club and only one has inteligence quotient below that of long dead fluffy albert. each team member brings to the table very specific set of highly technical skills - but we must admit to have among us one of those "ux-whatever-she-wants-to-call-herself" ... person... she's cool though and very much like the rest of us automated and robotic.

so regardless of how backward with tech your bunch of loosers is give us half a year and you will have very well oiled machinery constantly designing and developing highly engaging and audience specific interactive web aplications (interGraphics), which then they will be deploying on the web utilising every possible chanel of delivery.

sounds improbable? well you would be surprised how convincing and motivational might be raging 110kg of pure geeky power armed with katana and a granade. he always menages to convince me and trust me i can be really stuborn piece of shit.

anyway just fucking call us or drop us a message
